# 🏎️ Race Analytics: Predicting F1 Champions

## 📌 Overview
Formula 1 is a sport where milliseconds define the difference between victory and defeat. This project leverages **Machine Learning** to analyze historical F1 data and predict race outcomes, providing insights for fans, teams, and analysts. 🚀

## 📊 Key Factors Influencing Race Outcomes
- **Car Performance**: Engine power, aerodynamics, tire grip.
- **Team Strategies**: Pitstop timing, tire management, race tactics.
- **Weather Conditions**: Rain, temperature, wind effects.
- **Driver Skill**: Experience, consistency, adaptability.
- **Track Characteristics**: Layout, surface conditions, overtaking zones.

## 📂 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Source**: Ergast API (Historical F1 race data)
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing data into eras based on F1 regulation changes.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **Data Collection** - Gathering race statistics from 2020-2023.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Identifying trends, visualizing key insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Combining datasets, feature engineering, normalization.
4. **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning** - Testing various ML models.
5. **Model Evaluation** - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **User Interface (Planned)** - Interactive platform for predictions.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **📊 Decision Tree** - Simple tree-structured classification model.
- **🌲 Random Forest** - Ensemble model for better accuracy.
- **📈 Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** - Classifies data with optimal hyperplanes.
- **🧠 Neural Networks** - Deep learning approach for complex decision-making.

## 🔍 Results & Insights
- Feature importance analysis indicates **starting grid position, tire strategy, and weather conditions** significantly impact race outcomes.
- Random Forest provides **higher accuracy** compared to Decision Trees and SVC.
- Future improvements involve incorporating **real-time data streams** and **enhancing the UI for live race predictions.**

## 🚀 Future Work
- 📌 **Combine & refine datasets** for better generalization.
- 🏎️ **Fine-tune model hyperparameters** to improve performance.
- 🎛️ **Develop an interactive UI** for user-friendly predictions.
- 🌎 **Expand dataset** to include more seasons for robust insights.
